# DCS python client

(c) Crown copyright; not open source

A client to check passport validity using the [Document Checking Service (DCS) API](https://dcs-pilot-docs.cloudapps.digital/message-flow/#message-flow).

This client is currently missing:

- [ ] documentation, including guidance on creating the necessary keys and certificates
- [ ] error handling
- [ ] the ability to handle non-error responses; such responses are simply printed to stdout
- [ ] tests - both unit and integration
- [ ] a stub DCS to give non-governmental users something to run this client again
- [ ] the ability to send in custom passport data
- [ ] publication to pypi.org
